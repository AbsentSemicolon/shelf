v1.0 - Initial release.
v2.0 - Added bucket reference name and metadata initialization at the time of artifact creation.
v2.1 - Corrected bucket ref name to work with bucket update, removed unnecessary body of 201 response on artifact creation, and fixed link format to match specifications.
v2.2 - Fix for bulk update and bucket name/reference name where metadata was
not updated if the reference name was changed
v3.0 - Add the ability to do a search with no body (essentially a wildcard path search), added a script which prunes the search index of old reference or
bucket names, also minor bug fixes.
v4.0 - Added createdDate which will automatically be added to metadata when an
artifact is created
v5.0 - createdDate again but this time with a simpler implementation (that
doesn't account for actual create date of existing items).  This has to do
with a limitation in boto/s3.
